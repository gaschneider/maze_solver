# Welcome to the AmazeING Solver

This project will generate random mazes and solve them while shows to you the path the algorithm took to get to the solution

PS: Still working on this

## How to setup

- Make sure you have python 3 installed

## How to run

- Clone the repo locally
- Run `sh main.sh` in your terminal, it will pop open a screen that will draw a maze, then start flood it until it find the solution

## Improvements

- [ ] Add other solving algorithms, like breadth-first search or A*
- [ ] Make the visuals prettier, change the colors, etc
- [ ] Mess with the animation settings to make it faster/slower. Maybe make backtracking slow and blazing new paths faster?
- [ ] Add configurations in the app itself using Tkinter buttons and inputs to allow users to change maze size, speed, etc
- [ ] Make much larger mazes to solve
- [ ] Make it a game where the user chooses directions
- [ ] If you made it a game, allow the user to race an algorithm
- [ ] Make it 3 dimensional
- [ ] Time the various algorithms and see which ones are the fastest

# Thanks to

- Boot.dev for the idea of this project and putting in practice some graph algorithms, also for the improvements suggestions
